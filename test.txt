How to Use This Schedule
	1.	Allocate One Hour Daily
	•	15 minutes: Skim the theory highlight for the day’s problem. Note any relevant patterns or data structures needed.
	•	45 minutes: Solve the day’s problem. First, outline your approach, then code it. If you get stuck, revisit the hints in the theory or similar patterns you’ve practiced.
	2.	Track Progress & Revisit
	•	Keep notes on each problem – especially the steps that were not obvious.
	•	As you move forward, see if you can draw parallels between new problems and previously solved ones (e.g., same pattern, slightly different constraints).
	3.	Focus on Understanding
	•	Even if some problems feel repetitive, they reinforce essential techniques (e.g., two-pointer, sliding window, BFS/DFS on graphs, DP states).
	•	By Week 12, you’ll have a strong foundation of common interview topics.
	4.	Optional Extra
	•	If you have leftover time, do brief “flash reviews” of earlier problems.
	•	Practice explaining your reasoning out loud, simulating real interviews.

Following this one-problem-per-day plan for 12 weeks will steadily build familiarity with a wide range of data structures and algorithmic patterns. Good luck with your preparation!
